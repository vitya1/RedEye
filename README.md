# RedEye

A typical office worker spend 9 hours watching at a screen in average.
RedEye application is the way to never forget about taking a break for you and your eyes.

Built with Flutter (which is cool), lightweight and opensource forever.

## Getting Started
The application reminds you to take a break every 20 minutes (following 20-20-20 rule - every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds) and even suggests to do eye exercise once an hour.

Push notification when the application is running in background. Need to stop - just close.

Tested only for Android devices (you are welcome to test app for other platforms (e.g. different android devices)).

## Installation
Nothing special. Build just like typical flutter project
